**Some macOS users encounter issues if they do not have Watchman installed on their machine, so if you are using a Mac we recommend that you install it. [Download and install Watchman.](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html)**

## Usage

## UPDATE --- The server is now running on heroku so you can just follow the instructions for running the app via Expo on your device or an emulator. 

Run by using

```bash
npm run start || expo start
```

To run on an iOS simulator, follow the instructions available on the [Expo website.](https://docs.expo.io/versions/v36.0.0/workflow/ios-simulator/)
